# Photo Manager
This is an evolving personal project to develop a Photo Management system to collect and refine my image and video files scattered throughout my PCs and cloud services. The development approach is to apply Agile methodologies, especially Test-Driven Development (TDD). Of course, it is a one-person project, so some leniency in Agile application may occur.
